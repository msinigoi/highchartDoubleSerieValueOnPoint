# highchartDoubleSeriesValue

Highchart demo to demonstrate how to write chart's point labels using two different
series.


In the chart.js file the dataLabels parameter use a function in the
formatter to go through the series. Using the same index on both series we can show
the value of any given series and plot it as we want.
